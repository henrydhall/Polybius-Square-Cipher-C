# Polybius-Square-Cipher-C
Implementation of Polybius Square Cipher in C.

README.md: What you're reading right now.

commands.txt: I don't like remembering what commands I need for compiling a C program, so I've included it for now.

polybiussquare.c: This is where the magic will happen. It will be the program that runs and does the encrypting, decrypting, everything.

# TODO's
There is a lot to do. Basically I'm making a C program from scratch for the first time which I've never done. So to start I need to get on my feet with C. I need to implement encrypting letters by converting chars to ints, and printing to stdout. Next up is decrypting them. 

Along the way I'll need to figure out how I want to create and run unit tests, if I want to have separate .c and .h files.
